Project "Brain games" is aimed at introducing main components of any modern js-application (package manager (npm), transpiler (Babel), linter (Eslint). 
As part of the project, I implemented a set of the following mini-games:
1. Game: "Is it an even number?"
2. Game: "Calculator"
3. Game "GCD"
4. Game "Arithmetic progression"
5. Game "Is it a prime number?"
